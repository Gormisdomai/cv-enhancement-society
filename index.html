                <p>We know you're busy. So we created the perfect society for ambitious, talented, and driven individuals at the University of Oxford who want to take a leadership role in student life - but without taking on another burdensome commitment. </p>
                <p>With the CV enhancement society, you don’t need to come to any taster sessions, tryouts, trainings, talks, rehearsals, socials, drinks, dinners, meetings, or networking events. To maximise our members’ leadership potential, we have a rotating presidency: every day a new member becomes the President of the Society.</p>

                <h3>Rob, PPE, Brasenose College:</h3>
                <p>Finally a society which understands my basic needs! By cutting out superfluous procedural requirements, the Oxford CV Enhancement Society has distilled the Oxford society experience to its essential core. I hope to apply the skills I have gained as President by working as a strategic growth synergies executive in the premier digital solutions industry.</p>

                <h3>Liz, Biochemistry, St Edmund Hall:</h3>
                <p>I was a finalist, and between exam preparation, my college sportsball crewdates, and drinks and canapés with consulting firms, it felt like time was running out to improve my LinkedIn profile with extracurricular activities. But then I discovered the CV enhancement society. My work as a member and President of the society was surprisingly easy to fit into my schedule, but incredibly rewarding and beneficial.</p>

                <p>The CV enhancement society provides a well-selected global network of driven, dedicated alumni, in many industries. The CV enhancement lifetime membership is an investment in your future.</p>

                <h3>Ann, English Language and Literature, Wadham College:</h3>
                <p>I found the CV society’s approach to leadership refreshing. It’s not about who you know. The CV enhancement society’s egalitarian model fights the entrenched structures of institutionalised privilege in Oxford. Thanks to the rotating presidency, committee members are regularly replaced by new people with fresh and radical ideas for leveraging this important role.</p>

                <h3>Amir, Engineering, Blackfriars:</h3>
                <p>I’ve always wanted to give back to others. Volunteering as the unpaid president of a student society seemed like the perfect way to bring a positive contribution to my community. The Oxford CV enhancement society works to improve young people’s chances on today’s tough job market - knowing that I’m helping others is worth much more to me than getting another prestigious internship</p>

                <p>I always knew I wanted to get involved in one of the hundreds of societies on offer at Oxford, but I struggled to find the one that would motivate me to actually attend or organise any events. Though I was passionate about demonstrating to employers that I am a team player with lots of initiative and grit, I realised I wasn’t really that keen on any sports, art forms, cultures, religions, sciences, humanities, or political movements. That’s when I discovered the CV enhancement society - becoming a member has allowed me to develop my interests and flourish as a student.</p>
